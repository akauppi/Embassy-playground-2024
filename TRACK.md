## Embassy incompatibility with `nightly` >= `2024-06-13`

- [ ] ["Can not build on nightly rust [...]"](https://github.com/ch32-rs/ch32-hal/issues/29)

	Once solved, remove the mention of nightly version in `README`.
	
- [ ] ["macro expansion broken on latest nightly (2024-06-13)"](https://github.com/ch32-rs/ch32-hal/issues/29)

	"Next crates.io release will include the fix."
	
	= that would be anything > 0.4.1 [link](https://crates.io/crates/embassy-executor-macros)
